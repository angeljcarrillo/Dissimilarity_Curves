## Abstract

The dissimilarity between two contours is a major problem in computer vision systems that must distinguish and cluster different contours. In this contribution a quantitative approach for measuring dissimilarity between two contours is proposed. Any contour can be represented by the slope chain code, which is invariant under translation, rotation, and scale. The proposed method normalized both contours with same number of segments, then generates sub-chains of tortuosity along both chains and calculates the energy between the sub-chains, returning a normalized dissimilarity value from 0 to 1. Finally, the usefulness of the method is presented with an application on fish otoliths.
